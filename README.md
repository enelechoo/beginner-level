#Iris flower data set#
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. Based on the four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width), Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distiguish the species from each other.

The dataset became a typical test case for statistical classification techniques in machine learning.
