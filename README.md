# Iris flower data set #
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. Based on the four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width), Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distiguish the species from each other.

The dataset became a typical test case for statistical classification techniques in machine learning. 

## Data content ##
The dataset contains 150 samples with the following 5 attributes:
1. Sepal length in cm
2. Sepal width in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal width in cm
5. Species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica

## Libraries ##
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib

## Statistical summary ##

## Visualisations ##
### Box plots ###
Compares the distributions of:
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width

### Violin plots ###
Visualise the distribution and probability density of:
1. Petal Length
2. Petal Width

The thick black bar in the center represents the interquartile range, the thin black line extended from it represents the 95% confidence intervals, and the white dot is the median. 

### Pairplot ###
Compares the relationship between variables across multiple dimensions using scatterplots
